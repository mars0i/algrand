;; POLYNOMIAL ARITHMETIC MOD POLY

;; Additiion and substraction need to mod wrt the underlying integer
;; modulus, but don't need to mod wrt the primitive polynomial as long
;; as the arguments have already been normalized by modding.

;; Division needs to be able to mod wrt the integer modulus, but doesn't 
;; need to mod wrt to the primitive polynomial, as long as the
;; arguments have already been modded wrt it, because the result can't
;; be any longer than the dividend, so they don't need modding wrt the 
;; polynomial.  Even though division uses multiplication, it's always
;; just single-term multiplication, so it doesn't need the polynomial mod.

;; Only multiplication needs mod wrt the primitive polynomial, because
;; the raw result might have higher degree than is allowed.

;; (Perhaps I should add a polynomial arg to addition, subtraction, and
;; division, but it won't do anything.  I suppose it might be useful
;; for passing these functions as options with the same args.  Cross that
;; bridge if and when the need arises.)

;; No--as long as the coefficients can only be elements of a finite prime

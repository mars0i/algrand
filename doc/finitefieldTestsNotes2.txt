From Alanen and Knuth's "Tables of Finite Fields", Sankhya, 1964, pp.
305-328, section 5:

-------------------------------------
F3^4

From p. 312, the following is a list of coefficients for the elements in
F81, more specifically in F3^4 - {0}.

Per p. 310, the primitive ("indexing") polynomial is on page 321: 

        x^4 + x^3 + 2

This is represented as "1002", where 1 is the coefficient of the fourth
term starting from lowest terms on the right.  The first x^4 is assumed.
(This is a slightly clearer in section 6, where same primitive
polynomial is the first listed primitive polynomial in the table of all
such for GF(3^4) on page 316.)

Below, higher powers are on the left, arranged in order as powers of x.
This is a cut-and-past from the PDF.  The second element in the list is
x^1, i.e. 0x^3 + 0 x^2 + x + 0.  The first is x^0 = 1, i.e.  0x^3 + 0
x^2 + 0x + 1.  The last entry is equal to x^79.  (Note x^80 = x^{81-1} =
1 per a well-known theorem that A&K state, or 1.4.13 in N&W.) Further
below I give this transformed into my Clojure representation of
polynomials.

Here is the same list in my Clojure vector representation of
polynomials, with lowest terms on the left--i.e. the reverse of A&K's
representation:

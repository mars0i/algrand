Using algrand.kraftchaitin.clj
===

kraftchaitin.clj contains an implementation of the algorithm in proof of
the Machine Existence theorem 2.2.17, pp. 88f in Andr√© Nies'
*Comutability and Randomness*, Oxford University Press 2009.  This
theorem is more commonly known as the Kraft-Chaitin theorem, as in e.g.
Calude's *Information and Randomness*.  Downey and Hirschfeldt call it
the KC theorem.

## Examples of suggested usage:

You might find that it's convenient to use these functions in an
exploratory manner at a Clojure REPL.

(1) The following displays a list of prefix-free input strings (the *w*'s) and a
sequence of *R*<sub>0</sub> , *R*<sub>1</sub>, etc.  These are lists of
strings representing available intervals for subsequent *w*'s.  Note
that the list of *w*'s and the list of *R*<sub>n</sub>'s are each in
revers order: the most recently generated value is first, and the oldest
value is last.

```clojure
(clojure.pprint/pprint
  (ws-and-Rns [3 3 5 2 3 6 9 10 9 9 10 11]))
```

The sequence of numbers above is a set of requested input string
lengths.  `pprint` isn't essential, but formats the output for easier
reading.

(2) To see the intervals to which each string corresponds, use
`interval-of`.  For example, you might want to look at the intervals
corresponding to the generated *w*'s and the intervals represented by the
strings in the last *R*<sub>n</sub>.  This will allow you to verify
that all of the intervals together partition *[0,1)$.  For example:
```clojure
(use 'clojure.pprint)

(let [[ws Rns] (ws-and-Rns [3 3 5 2 3 6 9 10 9 9 10 11])]
  (pprint (sort (map interval-of ws)))
  (pprint (sort (map interval-of (first Rns)))))
```

code strings.  The second list contains the intervals representing
still-available intervals in the last *R*<sub>n</sub>.
